### Setup Instructions
clone down the repo and run npm install.

**Notes:**

I have added extra comments for some explanations, makes the code look a bit messy.

For "production hosting" i went with Google Cloud Services, here is the URL.

.env has been commited just for ease of deployement, i wouldnt usually do this.

**Live demo**

Hosted on Google Cloud
